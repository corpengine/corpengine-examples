# CORP Engine
An engine made with Pygame for Python game development.

## What is CORP Engine and Why Should I Use It?
CORP Engine is an engine/toolkit made with Pygame which can really make your python game development experience more organized, faster, and better in general. It works with a built-in parent-children system with gameObjects and services to use. Also, the entire engine code is in a single file, making it _really_ easy to set up.

### Guide For Setting up CORP Engine
* You can use this repository as a template if you want, or  `git clone` it to your local machine. _(This will require git.)_
* Alternatively, you can download `corpengine.py` file and `res` folder to a new project folder, but I would still recommend method 1.


## Learning CORP Engine
Currently, there is no wiki that can  actually make you understand how this engine works. But if you want to see some examples to learn how to work, check this repository out:
